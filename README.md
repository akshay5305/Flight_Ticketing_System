# Flight_Ticketing_System
 Cloud Deployment – Hosted using [https://flightpricesystem.streamlit.app/] for real-time usage.

Associated with BNM Institute of Technology

🚀 Overview
This project aims to predict flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques, enabling users to make informed decisions before booking. The model considers multiple features like airline, source, destination, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, and more.

The final model is deployed on the cloud with a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

🔍 Problem Statement
Flight prices vary drastically based on multiple factors. By analyzing historical data, we can build a predictive model that estimates flight ticket prices with reasonable accuracy—helping users plan travel more efficiently and save costs.

🌟 Key Features
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, converting date/time formats, encoding categorical variables.

✅ Feature Engineering – Extraction of relevant features such as total duration, time gaps, and airline-route combinations.

✅ Machine Learning – Trained with multiple regression algorithms (Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.) to find the best performer.

✅ Model Evaluation – Used metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² to validate model accuracy.

✅ Interactive UI – Clean interface that allows users to input flight details and get instant price estimates.
